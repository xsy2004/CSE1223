Because I could not stop for Death
	BY EMILY DICKINSON

Because I could not stop for Death ñ
He kindly stopped for me ñ
The Carriage held but just Ourselves ñ
And Immortality.

We slowly drove ñ He knew no haste
And I had put away
My labor and my leisure too,
For His Civility ñ

We passed the School, where Children strove
At Recess ñ in the Ring ñ
We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain ñ
We passed the Setting Sun ñ

Or rather ñ He passed Us ñ
The Dews drew quivering and Chill ñ
For only Gossamer, my Gown ñ
My Tippet ñ only Tulle ñ

We paused before a House that seemed
A Swelling of the Ground ñ
The Roof was scarcely visible ñ
The Cornice ñ in the Ground ñ

Since then ñ 'tis Centuries ñ and yet
Feels shorter than the Day
I first surmised the Horses' Heads
Were toward Eternity ñ
